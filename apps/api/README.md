# this the folder that contain the backend 
its build with fastify and trpc 
the goal is to have the main part of the
backend in trpc and have a minimal set  of endpoint with fastitfy
its was originaly  made with solid-start but i could not figure
out a correct approach to pass credential between trpc and 
there api layer   this a big bummer cause its required to make targeted query
there was other  bug in the user interface  with ssr
while i was relaoding the query were not send again  
i had to find alternative  while its still early in the repo 
i made some good learning about trpc and sold-start
